============= Эскадра =============

Everyone's born in this world for something
Everyone has a vocation here
Everyone's needed here, no accidents
Everyone's assigned his life's own route
But not all know about this
Someone, for years, still seeks for himself
Someone's got bogged down in the snowball of problems
Somebody hasn't thought about it at all

Chorus:
Each of us is like a ship
Sailing between reefs and rocks
And I'm sailing and praying only about
Everyone finding what he seeks
(twice)

Mission of everyone is needed for the world
It's a pity that many fail to recognize it
All needs would have been resolved in full
If everyone had known what he lives for
But obviously this is root of all evil
People do not appreciate themselves and others
The one who found himself in this world
Ceased to divide into brothers and foreigners

(Chorus)

Life can flow like quite rivulet
Or storm like large ocean
People's nature is diversiform
The choice of one's fate is given to oneself

(Chorus)


============= Инна =============

"Starfishes"
(Note that in Russian, "starfish" is literally spoken as "sea star")

We've just arrived from railway station
Put down our suitcases
And now, handfuls of laugh,
Everywhere joyfully we carry

Now we're going to go to the beach
Summer, sea, meet us!
Will hang out and swim in the sea
Hey, driver, full throttle!


Chorus:
A-ah, we are starfishes
A-ah, we are all starfishes
Stars we are here, well merely stars
Stars we are all...


The sun smiles to us
We frolic under palms
And the tide is philandering
with the most beautiful (of us)

And when late evening in a moment
occludes the sky with eyelids
With starry dances
we will conquer discotheques

(Chorus)


============= Женя =============

How good's that we're not in a hurry today
We'll spend all day on our whims
Won't get out from under the blanket
Until getting tired of lying in
Today, we've got lazy day
We've got good grace

It's cold in the street
It's almost January
But with our central heating
No fear for any severe frost

You're basking in the bed
I'll not wake you up
Will go to the kitchen
And attempt surprising you with something

I'll make a tea
Of your green eyes' color
I know, definitely know
That you're contented now
Sitting in your nightgown
(Now you wear the same as when slept)
On the head, there's cuckoo nest,
but nonetheless you're nice for me

We will fool around the guitar
And paint the green forest
Listen to cassettes
Watch movies on VHS
I'll take Dendy off the shelf
(  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendy_(console)  )
And also other various garbage
We'll be behind the times
That's it! Who cares about us?

I don't wish to think
About what will be tomorrow for me
It's not important what's occurred
And what's come to what
During the hour when we "suffered" with humbug
Let the world toppled over
And we're hanged upside down
Let everything rolls downhill
We'll burn our bridges (lit. "knock the bridges down behind us")
By the wing, as a canopy
I'll hide you from this mortal coil
Want to lose myself
In your thicky hair
Nothing's now important
The only thing that matters for me is
sheen in your eyes

How good's that we've nowhere to run today
Wanna breathe with you in unison, together
Let's get stuck again for a day, in one of these fine days
It's inexpressible in words
How good I feel together with you
